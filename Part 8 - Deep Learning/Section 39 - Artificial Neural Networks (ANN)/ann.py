# Artificial Neural Network

# Installing Theano
# Open source library for computations. 
# Doesn't only run on the CPU, but on the GPU as well.
# pip install --upgrade --no-deps git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git

# Installing Tensorflow
# Also a library for computations. Can run on a CPU or GPU. 
# Install Tensorflow from the website: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup.html

# Installing Keras
# Used for building deep learning models with few lines of code.
# "Wraps" Theano and Tensorflow.
# pip install --upgrade keras

# Part 1 - Data Preprocessing
